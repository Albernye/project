ROADMAP – Indoor Routing System (Summer 2025)

PHASE A: Data Collection & QR System
[ ] Build simple mobile prototype (Expo or native) to read QR & send sensors
[ ] Generate and print QR codes for rooms 201–225
[ ] Deploy local Flask endpoint `/collect_sensor_data`

PHASE B: Routing via PostGIS
[ ] Build `/route?from=X&to=Y` endpoint using pgRouting (Dijkstra)
[ ] Export paths as GeoJSON for map overlays

PHASE C: Offline PDR & Fingerprinting
[ ] Test PDR accuracy on existing recordings
[ ] Generate room baselines from Wi-Fi stats
[ ] Develop fingerprinting + confidence score

PHASE D: Fusion & Recalibration
[ ] Implement basic Kalman Filter (manual or FilterPy)
[ ] Automatically recalibrate via Wi‑Fi when deviation >2m
[ ] Improve sensor fusion logic in `fusion.py`

PHASE E: Web UI & Map Display
[ ] Show current position on Leaflet map
[ ] Display suggested route in web UI
[ ] Auto-update position on the fly (polling or socket)

PHASE F: Deployment
[ ] Dockerize backend
[ ] Host on Railway/Render or internal UOC server

PHASE G: Monitoring & UX
[ ] Log sensor errors and fusion failures
[ ] Add email or Slack alerts for outages
[ ] Write setup, user, and developer documentation
[ ] Create a user-friendly README with setup instructions
[ ] Add comments and docstrings to all scripts
[ ] Ensure code is modular and reusable for future projects
