ROADMAP – Indoor Routing System (Summer 2025)

PHASE A: Data Collection & QR System
[x] Build a simple mobile prototype (Expo or native) to read QR & send sensors
[x] Generate and print QR codes for rooms 201–225
[x] Deploy local Flask endpoint `/collect_sensor_data`

PHASE B: Routing via PostGIS (On Hold)
[ ] PgRouting and Dijkstra are on hold for now

PHASE C: Offline PDR & Fingerprinting (On Hold)
[ ] Fingerprinting and Wi-Fi baselines are on hold
[ ] Simulations to be done on PDR behavior combined with QR for validation

PHASE D: Fusion & Recalibration
[x] Basic Kalman Filter implementation
[x] Automatic recalibration via Wi-Fi (if deviation >2m)
[x] Improved sensor fusion logic in `fusion.py`

PHASE E: Web UI & Map Display (In Progress)
[x] Start front-end work
[x] Show position and user marker on Leaflet (real-time update)
[x] Room change detection and immediate marker update
[x] QR event logging and integration with Flask backend
[x] Simulate and visualize results (API route tests, fusion logic)

PHASE F: Deployment
[ ] Dockerize backend
[ ] Host on Railway/Render or internal UOC server

PHASE G: Monitoring & UX
[x] Log sensor errors and fusion failures
[x] Automated API and unit tests (run_all.sh, test scripts)
[x] User-friendly README
[x] Robust error handling in JS and Flask
[ ] Email/Slack alerts for outages
[ ] Setup, user, and developer documentation
[ ] Comments and docstrings
[ ] Modularity and reusability
